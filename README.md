# Stock_Prediction
This project predicts stock prices using machine learning techniques in Python. It uses historical stock data to train a predictive model and generate future price predictions.
## Features
- Data collection from financial sources
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Machine learning model training (e.g., Linear Regression, LSTM, etc.)
- Stock price prediction visualization
## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
2. Install dependencies:
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells step by step.

## Dataset
This project uses historical stock price data from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).

## Results

This is first time trying this. The work is not my original but from someone else and i will put their site.

As i am learning i will try to make my own in future but this just one of the experiment.
